        As someone who wants to keep learning new things, I have picked up a few different hobbies. 
        Computers have always been a hobby of mine, but I have always had a particular love for Audio. 
        Audio Engineering has always interested me in how the Amps, Diaphragms, and Active Processing 
        function to capture a person's true to life unique voice. Another Hobby of mine is Photography, 
        less about people, more about nature. I love stary nights and recently have been able to capture 
        my love for them onto a tangible and physical object, which is fascinating to me. A place where 
        my hobbies of computers and photography meet is my love for drones. Drones are the best of both 
        worlds and can capture things that you can't even tell are there. Flying above a mountain and 
        getting an entirely different perspective is a fantastic feeling, let alone when you fly low and 
        fast; that adrenalin rush makes you feel like a little kid again.
